# GitHub Copilot Workspace Instructions
## Thessaloniki Airbnb Market Analysis Project

This workspace contains a comprehensive data analytics portfolio project analyzing Thessaloniki's short-term rental ecosystem. When assisting with this project, always consider:

### Project Context
- **Client**: Thessaloniki Tourism Development Authority
- **Goal**: Evidence-based policy recommendations for sustainable tourism growth
- **Dataset**: 4,700+ Airbnb listings with calendar data
- **Timeline**: 6-week project (June 26 - August 7, 2025)

### Core Hypotheses Under Analysis
1. **H1 (Regulatory)**: Licensed vs unlicensed property performance (98% compliance baseline)
2. **H3 (Host Impact)**: Multi-property hosts (3+ listings) vs individual host dynamics
3. **H4 (Sustainability)**: Availability patterns (>50%) and guest engagement correlation
4. **H5 (Geographic)**: City center vs peripheral area performance patterns

### Key Deliverables
1. Interactive Power BI Dashboard
2. Statistical Analysis Report (Python-based hypothesis testing)
3. Executive Summary for Tourism Authority
4. GitHub Portfolio with professional documentation

### Technical Stack
- **Analysis**: Python (pandas, scipy, statsmodels, scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Power BI, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Geospatial**: folium, geopandas
- **Documentation**: Markdown, Jupyter notebooks

### Quality Standards
- All statistical tests must report effect sizes, not just p-values
- Visualizations must be colorblind-accessible
- Code must include docstrings and type hints
- Analysis must separate description from evaluation

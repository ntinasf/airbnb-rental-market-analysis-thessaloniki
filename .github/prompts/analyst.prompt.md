## Analysis Frameworks

### Host Segmentation Model
```
Individual Hosts (1 listing):
- Typically spare room/second home
- Lower professionalization
- Higher authenticity scores
- Seasonal availability patterns

Multi-Property Hosts (2-3 listings):
- Semi-professional operators
- Better pricing optimization
- Moderate response times
- Mixed property types

Portfolio Hosts (4+ listings):
- Professional management companies
- Highest operational efficiency
- Standardized guest experience
- Market share concentration concerns
```

### Seasonal Pattern Analysis
```
Peak Season (Jun-Aug): Beach tourism, high prices
Shoulder (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): Best value, cultural tourism
Low Season (Nov-Mar): Academic, business, digital nomads
Holiday Spikes: Easter (Greek Orthodox), New Year, festivals
```

### Geographic Performance Factors
```
City Center: Higher prices, better occupancy, more competition
Waterfront: Premium pricing, seasonal volatility
University Area: Academic calendar dependency
Airport Proximity: Transit stays, lower ADR
Residential: Local experience positioning
```

## Domain-Specific Questions to Consider

1. **Market Health**: Is the market growing sustainably or showing saturation?
2. **Host Diversity**: What's the individual vs. commercial host balance?
3. **Price-Quality Equilibrium**: Are prices aligned with guest satisfaction?
4. **Geographic Dispersion**: Is tourism too concentrated in specific areas?
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: What's the licensing adherence pattern?
6. **Seasonality Risk**: How vulnerable is the market to off-season decline?

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Listings with 100% availability (often inactive or mis-managed)
- Reviews per month > 10 (data anomaly or exceptional performance)
- Hosts with 20+ listings (potential platform manipulation)
- Price outliers (>3x or <0.3x market median)
- Instant bookable with 0 reviews (new or problematic listings)
- Minimum nights >30 (may indicate long-term rental disguised as STR)

## Response Guidelines

When asked about STR analysis:
1. Provide industry context before diving into data
2. Suggest relevant benchmarks and comparisons
3. Flag potential data quality concerns
4. Recommend actionable next steps for analysis
5. Consider regulatory and policy implications
6. Identify what insights would be most valuable for stakeholders
